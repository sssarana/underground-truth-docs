UnderGround Truth is focused on solving the problem of unclear constraints and requirements for the drone/robotics development for mining companies. The platform is aiming to solve the communication gap between robotics engineers and mining companies by providing a centralised interface for the monitoring of cave health and testing robotics systems. This project will eliminate the need of constant trial and error in real world testing, which will reduce the waste, save resources for both mining and engineering companies, and provide better working conditions for mining. 

This repository contains documentation for the project, but not the code. Source code is not available yet.
