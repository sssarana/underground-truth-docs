# List of all features
This may be a long journey. Take a cup of coffee.

## 3D Cave Visualisation
iTwin viewer allows this by default. The only thing added here is two toggle buttons that allow to remove/add top and bottom of the cave. 
This feature is a foundation of all other features. But just seeing the cave is not enough.

## Sensors Monitoring
First of all, we want to see some data. Each sensor has a marker, that you can hover on to see the values of each different sensor included in it. Worth mentioning that each 'sensor' is actually a block of different sensors in this application, which is a blessing and a curse, but can be modified with minimal effort. Each 'sensor' has data describing:
- CO2 level
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Dust level
- Ultrasonic data
Markers allow viewing the sensors positions and data. But again, it's not enough. We need to interpret the data.

## Obstacle Detection
The sensors are deployed in a special way, there is always one facing another. Considering this, we can figure out if there is anything on the way. If the ray from the sensor is shorter than the ray from the sensor on the other side - there is an obstacle. Another way of finding this is if we know the average 'width' of the cave, which is not really reliable nor accurate. If we have enough carefuly setup ultrasonic sensors data, we can accurately estimate the position and size of the obstacle, which is what UGT does.
If the obstacle is detected, the object of the estimated size is placed at the required position, so we can clearly see where and how big it is. It also adds marker, just like we have for sensors. However, this marker is screaming 'Look at me!'. It contains some information about size, position, and sensors it was detected from.
UGT checks for obstacles periodically, in this case it is done every 30 seconds, but it is adjustable.

## Zone Division
By default, the cave is one big zone. Users can split it into a number of zones, which will draw bounding boxes of different random colours around each. The maximum number of zones is the number of sensors. This is because for each zone we can monitor health, and without any sensors in the zone it is not possible. Once splitted into zones, each of them appears on the side panel, providing information such as average sensors values and overall health, is it good, bad, etc. The number of zones can be modified as many times as needed. If any zone is considered hazardous (any sensor values are dangerous), it will be dyed in red colour, which intuitively lets us think that something is wrong there. 
Zoning is impotrant and allows us to monitor health of the cave in a better, structured way.

## Hazard Notifications
If the zone is highlited in red, it is dangerous. But now you know this because you read the docs, not everyone does.. This is why, if any zone is dangerous, the notifications pop out continuously until the health is normalised, ensuring nobody can ignore the hazard. By continuously I mean that if you close notification but the zone is still dangerous, in one minute the notification will appear again. But what if the issue can't be fixed instantly?

## Escape Routes
If we can't fix th health of the zone, we need to escape it and let all people/robots in it to do the same. UGT provides you the most efficient escape route for each hazardous zone. What is mean by efficient:
- Next zone must be a neighbour that is NOT hazardous
- The neighbour should NOT have hazardous neighbour unless there is no other way
- The neighbour should NOT be in the end of the cave, always prioritise the route towards exit.
- The nighbour with a better health is prioritised if all of the above is satisfied.

The route is provided in the format like:
Zone 1 -> Zone 2 -> Zone 3
This is the simple way, but it works well.

## History Panel
Letting the app know the data in real time is great, but it's even better if it remembers it. In history panel, users can see how the health of the cave changed over time. For example, "CO2 level is 2% higher this week". This helps to predict the issues, and prevent the hazard. If we know the CO2 levels are rising, we can do something about it before it is dangerous.

## Drone Spawn
Users can also spawn the drone objects. At the moment, these are just cubes. All you need to do is to specify the dimensions, and click on the screen where you want the 'drone' to appear. Once this is done, the cube appears and on the panel you can see information about it, such as:
- Name (adjustable)
- Size
- Observability at current point (can drone see?)
- Material (adjustable)
- Moving ability (can drone move freely?)
- Failure Probability
By selecting a drone and pressing arrow buttons on the keyboard, users can move it around the scene.

This feature is a prototype of much bigger one - adding real drone models and testing them in combination with the model of the real environment. This is powerful because it is not just navigation testing, it is used to see if the drone will survive at all, and how useful it will be if survived.

## Advice Generation
Lastly, AI! I wasn't sure if it is worth including, since now this is the hot topic and almost every website has it (even if they don't need it...). Anyway, we do not have a chatbot. UGT allows users to generate the recommendations and considerations for the development of the drone. When the 'Generate' button is pressed, the data about the cave is passed to AI and it decides what to recommend. This, of course, is just a recommendation and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Some useful suggestions provided by the agent are:
- Suitable drone dimensions that can safely navigate the cave
- Required battery life (based on cave length and environment)
- Suitable primary material(s) considering temperature, humidity, and dust
- Any potential risks or operational constraints
- Shielding suggestions
