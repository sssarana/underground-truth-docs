# Goal of the project
Jumping straight to the goal would not make sense (though you could just scroll down). I want to share what problems UGT solves, some real data, and how this is supporting sustainability. Let's dive into it.

## Problem Statement
Drone failure in caves.

Caves and underground mines are inherently complex, hazardous, and unpredictable environments. Manual exploration is not only risky but also slow and expensive. Traditional mapping and monitoring techniques often suffer from low resolution, infrequent updates, and poor spatial integration of critical data like gas levels, structural stability, or navigable paths.

While drones and autonomous robots are increasingly used to address these challenges, a significant barrier to their effective deployment remains: testing and validating drones in such environments is extremely difficult.
Without a prior digital understanding of the cave:
- Engineers don’t know if the drone will physically fit through narrow or unstable passages.
- It’s unclear whether the drone’s sensors or communication systems will perform adequately underground.
- Environmental risks such as humidity, temperature, dust, and gas are often not accounted for until too late. This results in drone loss, wasted hardware, and non-recyclable electronic waste, alongside the waste of engineering time and R&D investment.
- Lack of real-world data creates a long iteration loop between design, testing, and deployment. A digital twin can shorten this loop dramatically by simulating real-world conditions early.

## Root Causes
- Lack of communication between engineers and mining staff: unclear specs lead to a lot of unknown criteria that can affect drone’s survivability and navigation.
- High cost of sensors integration in the caves
- People are not ready for automation
- A lot of constraints are not taken into account, because they may be unknown by both engineers and mining staff

## Who is affected?
- Engineers developing drones - product development is hard, can lead to a lot of wasted time in some cases.
- Planet! Too much waste.
- Mining industry - investing too much money in something that won’t necessarily work.
- Safety teams - hard to know the risks beforehand, forced to send people and drones in a cave blindly.

## Real statistics
High Drone Failure Rates: Approximately 25% of drones experience failures in various operations, underscoring the need for rigorous maintenance and planning. [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X24001969?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Human Error as a Major Factor: Studies indicate that 80–90% of drone accidents are attributed to human error, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive training and robust operational protocols. [Link](https://anvil.so/post/human-error-in-drone-operations-key-risks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Rapid Adoption in Mining: The mining sector has seen a significant uptick in drone usage, with 65% of mining operations investing in drone technology by 2022, up from 44% in 2018.

Efficiency Gains: Drones have been shown to reduce aerial survey costs by up to 90%, offering more accurate data and enhancing worker safety. [Link](https://tolluncrewedsystems.com/blog/how-drones-in-mining-boosts-efficiency/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The mining drone market is experiencing significant growth, with projections indicating an increase from USD 4.53 billion in 2024 to USD 12.32 billion by 2033, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5%.

## Sustainability
UGT achieves several Sustainable Development Goals, out of 17 defined by the [Untied Nations](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

- Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing
    - Reduces the need for humans to enter hazardous cave environments.
    - Helps emergency responders and safety teams plan safer operations.
- Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth
    - Enables safer and more efficient mining operations, improving productivity.
    - Encourages growth in high-tech and automation sectors.
- Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
    - Introduces digital twin technology to underground mining and exploration.
    - Fosters innovation in robotics, AI, and sensor integration.
- Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production
    - Reduces e-waste by minimizing drone failures and unnecessary prototypes.
    - Encourages efficient use of materials through better design testing and validation.
    - Reduces duplication of effort through shared, digital infrastructure.
- Goal 13: Climate Action
    - Reduce energy waste in mining operations.
    - Reduce carbon footprint from frequent drone manufacturing and testing.

## Finally, the goal
To create a digital twin platform for caves and underground mines that empowers engineers to design, test, and validate drones in realistic virtual environments — bridging the communication gap between engineering teams and mining operators, reducing failed deployments, and minimising environmental and financial waste through informed, collaborative development.

I could expand it a lot more, but the main mission is stated.
