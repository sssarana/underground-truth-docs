# Contribute to UnderGround Truth
I encourage the contributions to this project and would love to create an active community of developers around it. Whether you are fixing the bug, suggesting your idea, or helping me develop what I already have in mind - it is highly appreciated.

## Help current development
Currently, there is a lot to fix and develop. Here, I will list what is needed to make this application better. You can choose anything and create a PR.
- History Data Processing
At the moment the history panel has only placeholder data. You can contribute by replacing it with real calculations.
- Drone Spawning 
Right noe it is just a box. It would be great to allow loading real drone models, such as URDF or SDF.
- Simulate proper movement
Now the drone cspawned by user moves at predefined step size, it does not simulate flying movement properly.
- Healthmap generation
It would be great to have a 'healthmap' that looks like heatmap. It should be applied to the model, so we can see the surface in smoothly transitioned colours depending on health of the cave in the area.

## Suggest a feature
If you have a feature in mind, you can create an issue to indicate that you are working on it. It will also help you understand if this feature is needed at all. In your issue, please specify:
- Why this is needed?
- How this will modify the UI?
- Will you be able to develop it yourserlf or do you need help?
I am excited to see what you have in mind!

## Fixing bugs
If you found a bug, please report it by creating an issue. Or, if you found a fix, create a PR with your changes.

I will try to fix the bugs/merge the fixes as soon as I can.

No rules. 
Just don't include long-long comments, do not create 100000 lines long files, etc.
Modular development is encouraged.
