# About UnderGround Truth
The general information about the project is here.
UnderGround Truth was developed for several reasons. First of all, it is a part of Bentley iTwin Developer Program - a hackathon for students. However, it evolved beyond that. The project (currently a prototype) addresses some real problems, such as providing and understanding requirements, designing and testing drones/robots for constrained and unpredictable environments, and reducing e-waste. Lastly, here we are raising awareness about common engineering and mining challenges.

Sometimes, I will use UGT in these docs, which is simply an acronym for the project name.

## What is it?
UGT is a digital twin platform that allows to visualise the caves and underground mines. It allows engineering and mining operators to view real-time data of the cave and collaborate.
The platfrom allows users to view data, divide caves into zones, monitor the health of the cave and each zone in particular. It can also be used to gather recommendations from AI using the data already available in the platform. Users can spawn drone objects and move them, allowing more space for testing. Additionally, we can see if conditions in cave have changed over time. Any obstacles that appear are identifed and modeled in the iTwin. This is a lot, but this is only a beginning.

## Who is it for?
From engineers for engineers.
When shaping this idea, I thought about robotics engineers and their development challenges. But now, it is for everyone. Everyone can contribute to planet's wellbeing. If this platform will be used, we will be able to reduce the waste - failed drones, wasted money on unsuccesful projects, and of course sleepless nights of engineers. If you are reading this and want to help with development, you can totally do this by contributing to this project and promoting it.

## Technology used
iTwin technology (see [their repo](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core)) is at the core of the project. It makes the development easier, and it is open source.
TypeScript is the main development language.
3D modelling can be done in many ways, and you can choose yours. Just load it into your iTwin and ejoy.
For the real world deployment, we would need a lot of sensors, and someone to place them in the cave.

## Compatibility
It is a web application, therefore, compatible with anything. 

## Note from developer
By open sourcing this project, I am hoping to make it a collaborative effort towards the end goal. Anyone reading this can become my teammate, and this is important. I am trying to create a community, not just sell the idea.
