# Running the project locally

1. Create iTwin
Go to the Bentley's [iTwin website](https://itwin.bentley.com) and create an account.
Follow [this tutorial](https://developer.bentley.com/tutorials/get-started-with-itwin-platform/) to set up your iTwin.

2. Load model
The model that I used is provided in the repository. I found it online and added sensors. You can use it, or you can find/create your own cave model and load it via File Synchronisation.

3. Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/sssarana/underground-truth.git`

4. Create `.env` file
This is crucial to connect your digital twin to the application. Paste this into your file and fill in the required fields:
```
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=<add here>
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/signin-callback
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_LOGOUT_URI=http://localhost:3000
IMJS_AUTH_CLIENT_SCOPES=itwin-platform
IMJS_AUTH_AUTHORITY=https://ims.bentley.com

IMJS_ITWIN_ID=<add here>
IMJS_IMODEL_ID=<add here>

SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

USE_FAST_SASS=false
USE_FULL_SOURCEMAP=true
TRANSPILE_DEPS=false
USING_NPM=true

REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
```

5. Install dependencies
Run this command from the project root and it will install all necessary dependencies. If you have any issues, check the `patches` folder, maybe the issue has been fixed.
`npm install`

6. Run
`npm run start`
This will open a browser and will ask you to sign in to Bentley. After you do this, you should see your cave on the screen. Enjoy!
