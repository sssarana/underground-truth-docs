# UnderGround Truth Documentation

Welcome from the underground world!
Here, you can find information about the project. Hopefully, everything you wanted to know is here (I tried my best!). If this is not the case, you can always reach out by creating an issue.

To help you navigate, here is what you can find in each post:
- [General information](https://sssarana.github.io/underground-truth/2025/06/28/about.html)
If you want a quick introduction, without any nonsense, you can find it here.

- [Project Goal](https://sssarana.github.io/underground-truth/2025/06/28/goal.html)
The problem statement, goals, some statistics. For curious minds.

- [Features](https://sssarana.github.io/underground-truth/2025/06/28/features.html)
Find the list of all features and more information about them.

- [Usage](https://sssarana.github.io/underground-truth/2025/06/28/usage.html)
Here you will find instructions on setting up the project for further development or just testing.

- [Contributions](https://sssarana.github.io/underground-truth/2025/06/28/contributions.html)
If you want to contribute to the project, check the contributions page.
It does not only contain rules. If you do not have your idea for contributions, you can find some there and work on it.

- [Demo](https://sssarana.github.io/underground-truth/2025/06/29/demo.html)
Watch the demo of the project to understand it better. Best way to explain something is to show it.

Enjoy!
